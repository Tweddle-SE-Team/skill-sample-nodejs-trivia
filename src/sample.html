        <i>Forest River recreational vehicles are equipped with hydraulic or electric slide out systems, or a combination of both. In this manual, you will find general information that will pertain to all operations, and in addition, some more brand specific information. If the following procedure doesn't apply to your recreational vehicle, please consult the slide room manufacturer's owner's manual that you received with your recreational vehicle and follow those directions.</i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Before extending the room, check the exterior of the RV to be sure the room will not hit anything outside when it is fully extended and the interior to be sure the slide room travel
        <i>is free from obstruction.</i>
        <br/>
        <br/>        
        <b><font size="3">NOTE:</font></b>

        <br/>
        <b>We recommend that your RV be plugged into a 120VAC receptacle or have the generator running, during jack and slide out operation. This will help ensure that the battery maintains proper voltage during operation.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
         For optimum performance, the slide out system requires full battery current and voltage. The battery must be maintained at full capacity. If the battery is fully charged and you still do not have power, check the terminals and other connections at the battery.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b><font size="3">WARNING:</font></b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <i>Do not perform any maintenance work on your slide out system without first disconnecting the battery. Failure to do so could result in serious personal injury or death.</i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b><font size="3">NOTE:</font></b>
        <br/>
        <b>When operating the slide room, be sure there are no obstructions in the travel path. &nbsp;For more information, please consult the individual owner's manual</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Your RV may not be equipped with a manual crank. Please contact your dealer for more information.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>POWER FAILURE</b>
        <br/>
        <i>In the event of a power failure or low battery, the slide out room may be operated manually with a crank handle. (If you do not have one, you may order one from your Forest River dealer.) The manual crank shaft is located on the motor transmission housing. Turn the crank counter-clockwise to move the room IN and clockwise to move the room OUT.</i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>NOTE</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Do not make modifications to your recreational vehicle by adding after-market items (gooseneck adapters, hitches, bike racks, ladders, storage racks, etc.) without first obtaining written authorization from Forest River Inc. Doing so may cause damage to your RV and limit, reduce, or void your warranty.</b>
